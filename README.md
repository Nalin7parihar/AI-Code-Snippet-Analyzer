üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started
Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project up and running.

Prerequisites
Node.js (LTS version recommended)

npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Nalin7parihar/AI-Code-Snippet-Analyzer.git
cd AI-Code-Snippet-Analyzer

Install backend dependencies:

# If your backend is in a separate folder (e.g., 'server' or 'backend')
cd backend # or server
npm install
# cd .. # Go back to root if needed

Install frontend dependencies:

# If your frontend is in a separate folder (e.g., 'client' or 'frontend')
cd frontend # or client
npm install
# cd .. # Go back to root if needed

If your project is a single directory, you might only need npm install in the root.

Configure Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in your backend directory (and/or frontend if needed) and add your API keys or other sensitive information.

# Example for backend (replace with your actual API key)
AI_API_KEY=your_gemini_or_openai_api_key_here

Refer to your specific AI API documentation for required environment variables.

Running the Application
Start the backend server:

# From your backend directory
npm start # or node server.js, or npm run dev depending on your setup

The backend typically runs on http://localhost:5000 (or another port specified in your code).

Start the frontend development server:

# From your frontend directory
npm start # or npm run dev, or yarn dev

The frontend typically runs on http://localhost:3000 (or another port).

üí° Usage
Navigate to the frontend URL (e.g., http://localhost:3000) in your web browser.

Paste or type your code snippet into the provided input area.

Click the "Analyze" (or similar) button.

View the AI-generated analysis, explanations, and suggestions in the output section.
